# BAM Forums

This website started out as just a class project for my Intro to Web Development class, but as time went on, I became more attached to it. By the time the class ended, I decided I wanted to pursue this further. I am now working towards making this a legitimate website and getting it distributed to students of BSU.

## Introduction
For people that want to be able to get help from more than just your instructor or friends in your class, or for people looking for information about the fun they can have around their college and/or people they can have it with, I introduce:

Boise state

Activites and

Majors

A forum for all students of Boise State Univeristy to help and seek help from another for classes and fun. BSU has Piazza for class mates,  blackboard (also for class mates, except even harder to use), and clubs, sororities, etc., but they do not have anything to help students interact with one another unless they are already associated with one another. BAM Forums is a place where a student can ask help from any student willing to provide it about anything related to a major or an activity.
