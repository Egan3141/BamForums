#GetActive

This website started out as just a class project for my Intro to Web Development class, but as time went on, I became more attached to it. By the time the class ended, I decided I wanted to pursue this further. I am now working towards making this a legitimate website.

## Introduction
For people that love sports, love being outside, love just being active, but struggle to find places to do it, or even people to do it with, I introduce:

GetActive

A forum for people to discuss their favorite activity, learn about new activities, or find people to do any activity with. Whether you want to talk/learn about things as simple as walking to as multi-person dependent as rugby to as varied as parkour, GetActive has a place for it. Learn about the activity, find places to do the activity, and find people to do it with, all at GetActive.
